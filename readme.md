# Unicorn

This project is a text adventure called "Tales from the Golden Unicorn" created using
JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. I created it to explore natural language processing using
JavaScript/jQuery.

Currently the only commands available to the user are movement commands such as go north, go
south, etc. and look, which simply repeats the room description. It is a side project that I am
only working in my "spare time" so it is likely to progress slowly.
